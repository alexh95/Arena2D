# Arena2D

Arena2D is an experimental project attempting to create a game engine for 2D games.

It will include an example game for demonstrating the engine's capabilities.

## Features

* 3D movement system. While there is no inherent way of viewing vertical positioning, it is included since it can be used for special behaviors.
* 2D animation support using texture atlases (sprite sheets).

## Roadmap

### Version 0.3 -> 0.4
- [ ] Pathfinding

### Version 0.2 -> 0.3
- [ ] Connected wall entities mesh (to stop flickering) and better collision handling
- [ ] Enhanced collision model
- [x] Entity Health
- [ ] Attack
- [ ] Enemies

### Version 0.1 -> 0.2
- [x] WebGL: draw all texture objects

### Version 0.0 -> 0.1
- [x] Physics engine: acceleration and collisions, collision movement based on mass
- [x] Input handling: mouse handling, options toggling
- [x] Sprites and spritesheet animations
- [x] Tiles
- [x] Debug overlay (HTMLContext2D)
- [x] Entity model: collidable, spritesheet, repeatable (drawn multiple times)
