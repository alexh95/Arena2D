# Arena2D

Arena2D is an experimental project attempting to create a physics engine for 2D games.

It will include an example game for demonstrating the engine's capabilities.

## Features

* 3D movement system. While there is no inherent way of viewing vertical positioning, it is included since it can be used for special behaviors.

* 2D animation support using texture atlases (or sprite sheet).
